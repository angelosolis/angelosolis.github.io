				It's been my happiest ever since I've met you - the girl of my life. <br>
				Your presence fills my days with joy and my heart with love. <br>
				Every moment spent with you is a precious gift that I cherish deeply. <br>
				<br>
				I want you to know that my love for you knows no bounds. <br>
				It grows stronger with each passing day, and I am grateful for the deep connection we share. <br>
				You are the missing piece in my life's puzzle, and I am thankful for every moment we spend together. <br>
				<br>
				Thank you for being the amazing person that you are and for loving me unconditionally. <br>
				You have transformed my life in the most beautiful way, and <br>
				I am excited to continue this incredible journey with you.<br>
				<br>
				Forever and always, you have my heart.
